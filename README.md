## Hi there 👋

<!--
👋 I am a molecular biologist turned computational genomic scientist with 5+ years of experience analyzing next-generation sequencing data with expertise in melanoma, neurodegenerative disease, epigenetics, and RNA biology. 

🎓 I earned my PhD in Genetics & Genomics from Boston University School of Medicine where I discovered the role of the CoREST epigenetic complex in RNA splicing and developed a method to resensitize immunotherapy-resistant tumors to immune checkpoint blockade.

🧬 I was a Computational Genomics Intern at ReviR Therapeutics, an early stage RNA therapeutics company, where I spearheaded a computational pipeline to automate RNA splicing small molecule characterization and integrated it into an in-house data user interface for wet lab biology use. I also created a machine learning model trained on large-scale informatic datasets to predict nonsense-mediated decay induced by RNA splicing small molecules.
